### Purpose

### Mapmaking Process

Example of in process map 

1. Started with basemap of Esri Standard in Open Street Map
2. Zoomed into area of interest. For this map, it was the greater Lexington/Fayette County urban area
3. Added layers from 2022 U.S Census Bureau for zip code tabulation areas to highlight borders. Also, lines/edges download to highlight parcels, streets, and highways 
4. Added queries and values from Open Street Map to show polygon features for amenitites in each zip code
5. Added legend, north star, mileage bar, and other features to map layout
6. Completed the map by exporting to two resolutions: 1200dpi and 8000dpi

### Map summary

The purpose of this map is further reiterate the premise that an individual's zip code can be a better predictor of overall health outcomes and quality of life, than their genetic code. I wanted to highlight the inaccuracies of access to amenitites that promote a better quality of life, as well as show a visual representation of how resources are inequitably distributed.
